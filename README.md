# MOD-10-Counter-with-loading-data
MOD 10 counter is a counter which can generate 10 statees. And main feature Im adding here is that loading the data when we load the data more than 9 it wont accepts  and when we load with value less than 9 the value will be loaded into the counter and increments from that value, otherwise it performs mod 10 counter operation.
